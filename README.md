# Anime Page API (no actual api calls)

## Forking/Cloning Info

This project was a school assignment, copying it for academic use is prohibited.

## Features

### A fast and simple way to display info on the anime you want to watch.

# Known Issues

- Ghibli Bug: A bug where for some reason the Ghibli movies seem to cause the site to crash (related to the title_synonyms property of the API call)

- Mature Content filter filtering non-mature content: When you search for "My Hero Academia" or "Black Clover" you don't get the disered show. When Searching for "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood" You don't get the show, but you do get it with "Brotherhood" only. Possibly a bug in the Jikan API, but also might be on my end as well.
